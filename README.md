Component to expose Ecowatt levels for the foreseable future. See https://www.monecowatt.fr/ for web access.

## Installation

Use [hacs](https://hacs.xyz/).
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=kamaradclimber&repository=rte-ecowatt)

## Configuration

### Get api access for RTE APIs

- Create an account on [RTE API website](https://data.rte-france.com/web/guest)
- Register to the [Ecowatt API](https://data.rte-france.com/catalog/-/api/consumption/Ecowatt/v4.0) and click on "Abonnez-vous Ã  l'API", create a new application
- get the `client_id` and `client_secret` (uuid in both cases)

### Configure home-assistant

Quick reference:
```
sensor:
  - platform: rte_ecowatt
    api_client_id: XXXX
    api_client_secret: YYYY
    sensors:
      - unit: days
        shift: 2
      - unit: hours
        shift: 7
      - unit: hours
        shift: 36
```

Each sensor is configured to look at ecowatt level in the future. You can configure X hours in advance (up to 96 at the moment) to get the precise level at a given point in time.
You can also configure X days in advance (up to 3 days) to get the worst level of that day.

Two sensors are generated by default: "now" and "today".

An additional sensor exposing next downgraded period is also added by default (not configurable). It shows beginning of next period with tensions on the electricity network. During such a period, it shows the beginning of next hour.
